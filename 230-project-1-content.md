## Home page
Project 1 is all about having us create our own dynamic website using html and css that includes our documentation, game proposal, and finally the game we made for it.
 The game I am making will be a top-down wave survival game with a maze the player will traverse in order to find or escape from enemies.

## Proposal
1.High Concept
It's like pac-man except it is a wave based survival game.  The map will be maze like and the entirety of it will not be shown.

2.Genre
It will be a top-down survival shooter.

3.Platform
Will be on desktop and mobile.

4.Story
No real story, just the player seeing how far they can make it while upgrading weapons and stats.

5.Esthetics>
Cartoon style with retro sounds for player/enemy actions, area, and UI.

6.Gameplay
The main gameplay loop will be the wave spawns, player tries to survive the wave, if they succeed they will have a period of time to upgrade weapons and stats, if not they will be booted back to the main menu.

7.Screenshots
None yet since we have not started creating our games yet.

8.About the developer
I am currently a second year Game Design and Development student with an interest in programming, web design, Maya, and Unity.

## Documentation
Process:
The first step was to create the general layout of the site, have the project title at the top, a navigation bar for the other pages underneath that, and the content of that page underneath the navigation bar.
The second step was to go through each page and layout where its content would go and how it would look.
The third step was configuring it for mobile users on a 480 pixel screen
